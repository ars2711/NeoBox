## 🧠 Design Decisions

### Why Flask + SQLite?

Due to CS50's lectures and simply their simplicity and understanding - it made them such an easy choice.

### UI/UX

- Bootstrap 5.3 with custom CSS for a clean, minimal aesthetic.
- Responsive grid-based card layout for tools.
- Integrated dark mode with saved preferences via `localStorage`.

### User Data Handling

- Passwords hashed with Werkzeug's `generate_password_hash` (Inspired by CS50's Problem Set 9)
- Sessions securely managed using `flask-session`
- Email-based verification & reset via `Flask-Mail`

## 🤖 About Copilot & Contributions

Large portions of this project were accelerated using **GitHub Copilot**, particularly during UI problems, recurring snippets, form handling, and code bugs. However, each section was manually reviewed, tested, and understood before integration.

> This project would not exist without CS50, but Copilot greatly improved development efficiency.

## 📖 A Note from the Creator

Hey there! I'm Arsalan - the creator of **NeoBox**, and this web app has been my journey through learning and building with Flask, Python, and a whole lot of curiosity. NeoBox started off as just an idea for **CS50's Final Project**, but along the way, it grew to be way more and something that I thought many students and proffesionals alike would highly benefit from. While every programmer knows how to make a calculator, I thought of making something a _little_ more...

This project was never about writing perfect code. With the help of Github's Copilot (and some ChatGPT for general things), I was able to learn and write code more efficiently while being on the peak of my creative flow. I made sure to **understand**, **break**, and **fix** everything it suggested because after all; this was _my_ vision. And as I worked, I realized something powerful: building is learning, and sharing is growing, so I present this to you as a gift.

> "It ain't much but it's honest work."

Is NeoBox "done"? Not yet. But it's functional, ambitious, and built with love and that’s more than enough for me to hit submit proudly.

Thank you CS50 team for giving me a real reason to chase a dream I didn’t even know I had. This isn’t the end; it’s just the start.

> _Arsalan, 2025_

## 💬 Final Notes

NeoBox is a long-term vision that started as a CS50 project but is slowly evolving into what one (I) can only dream of. While it’s far from perfect today, it’s sprouting to be even bigger and better. Thank you for checking it out!
